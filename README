DISCLAIMER

The code for this module is taken almost entirely from the lwp-download
script found in LWP or libwww-perl. It has been abstracted into a 
module for better portability and re-use.

USAGE

my $dwn = File::Download->new({
    file => $argfile,
    overwrite => 1,
    mode => ($opt{a} ? 'a' : 'b'),
});

print "Downloading $url\n";
print $dwn->download($url);
print $dwn->status();
